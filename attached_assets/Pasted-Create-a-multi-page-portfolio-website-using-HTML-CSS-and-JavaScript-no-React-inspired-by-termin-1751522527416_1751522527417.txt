Create a multi-page portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no React), inspired by terminal/code editors, with a futuristic robotic touch. The layout should be unique but similar in feeling to code-based hacker UIs.

🎨 Theme:
- Dark mode (deep black background)
- Neon blue and cyan highlights (use gradients subtly)
- Monospace or futuristic fonts (Orbitron, JetBrains Mono)
- Glowing hover effects on links, buttons, and borders
- Add soft background code snippets as watermark (blurred, non-copyable)

🧭 Pages (Each page is separate HTML):
1. index.html – Landing + Navigation
2. about.html – About Moeed
3. skills.html – Skills & Stack
4. projects.html – Projects Gallery
5. contact.html – Contact Form

📄 Page Details:

🔹 index.html (Home Page)
- Hero section with:
  "Hi, I'm Moeed ul Hassan"
  "Python Web App Developer | Based in Gujrat, Pakistan"
- Use typing animation for intro lines
- Subtle matrix-style code animation in background
- Button: "Explore My World" → goes to about.html
- Vertical left-side navbar with icons and page links (glow on hover)

🔹 about.html
- Styled like a mission briefing panel
- Bio paragraph:
  “I’m Moeed, a self-taught developer with 1 year of freelancing experience (no commercial projects completed). I’ve built meaningful apps like Mail Hawk and Food Rescue Network, and now fully focused on job search.”
- Include a mini timeline of education
- Islamic values: truth, halal effort, self-discipline

🔹 skills.html
- Code console style layout
- Skills listed in vertical "command prompt" format:
  `$ show skills --full`
- Example outputs:
  ▪ Python → ★★★★☆
  ▪ FastAPI → ★★★★☆
  ▪ React → ★★☆☆☆ (Learning)
  ▪ Supabase, Git, Tailwind → ★★★☆☆
- Add progress bars styled like loading bars

🔹 projects.html
- Each project shown as a "digital chip card"
- Section 1: Completed Missions
  - Mail Hawk, Food Rescue Network, Addictions Blocker
- Section 2: Abandoned Missions (with faded glitch style)
  - Task Buddy, Freelance Shield, Talking Mask, PriceGenie
- Hover on each card → show tools used + short description

🔹 contact.html
- Terminal-style contact form:
  `$ send_message --to=Moeed`
- Name, Email, Message fields styled like input in code editor
- Send button: "Launch Transmission 🚀"
- Add Quranic footer line:  
  “Indeed, Allah is with those who do good.” – Surah Ankaboot 29:69

🔧 Extras:
- Make everything responsive with media queries
- Animations must be subtle, like blinking cursors, code scanline effect
- Avoid direct code copying from other portfolios – make layout original with creative touches (e.g., circular glowing buttons, command line input style forms, split layout sections)
