## Data Flow

### Static Content Rendering
1. HTML pages load with embedded Python code snippets as decorative watermarks
2. CSS custom properties provide consistent theming across all pages
3. JavaScript modules initialize page-specific functionality
4. Matrix canvas animation runs independently as background effect

### Navigation Flow
1. User interactions trigger navigation state changes
2. Active page detection updates sidebar highlighting
3. Smooth transitions provide visual continuity between pages

### Animation Pipeline
1. Matrix effect continuously renders falling characters
2. Typing animations trigger on page load for dynamic text
3. Hover effects activate on user interaction
4. Progress bars animate on skills page visibility

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Orbitron and JetBrains Mono font families
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library for navigation and UI elements

### No Backend Dependencies
- Pure frontend implementation
- No database requirements
- No server-side processing
- No third-party APIs or services

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Site Hosting
